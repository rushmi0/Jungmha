**Before reporting**

- This repository should be used to report **issues on the Maven or Gradle plugins for GraalVM**.
- Please report issues which are specific to [the Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) or [the Micronaut framework](https://micronaut.io/) to their specific repositories.
- Do not report issues with building your specific application, e.g errors which happen at image build time like classes initialized at build time, or missing classes as run time: those are not related to the plugins but problems with configuration. You can refer to the [GraalVM native image documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) for available options and the [plugins documentation](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools) for how to use them with the plugin.
